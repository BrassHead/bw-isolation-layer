Beyond 0.9 (Feb 2013)
=====================

There is not much point in upgrading this codebase. Here's what's changed:

-	some of the original classes are now much better formed in the standard library
		-	bw::String needs to be std::string containing utf-8 and ustring just needs to disappear
		-	bw::Exception(s) need to be subclasses of std::exception
		-	cptr needs to be unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr from <memory>
-	X and all windowing systems based on an event loop are now obsolete
		-	The drawing surface and primitives need to be based on OpenGL and/or OpenVG, not Xlib
		-	Controls (widgets) and text processing need to be based on HTML DOM (The "view" of MVC)
			with XML and/or JSON resources, composited with images/animations/video
		-	Input processing based on ECMA/Javascript (The "control" of MFC)
		-	Tied together with interthread messaging (like go channels)
-	remaining bits needs to be based on reverse dependency interface (callers only see their own 
	abstract interface needs and callee provide factory methods returning pointers to subclasses
	of the caller defined interface.
-	Not much left of current BW code with these changes...INI files, ODBC, file system directory, XML, asserts,
	maybe logging.
-	Salvaged code for new projects needs more c++11 upgrade:
		-	to_string() and sto???() instead of stringstreams
		-	std::strings, std::exceptions, std::???_ptrs
		-	check for loops for "auto" and "range-for" opportunities
		-	reverse dependency moves header files into caller
		-	some asserts should be exception throws
		-	Some list<>s should be vector<>s or array<>s
		-	add back release makefile target that just does "strip"
-	Save goes for salvaged application code.


Oh, and put "main", back in the application, even if it's not totally portable....just because
some people don't like international standards is no excuse...sheesh
