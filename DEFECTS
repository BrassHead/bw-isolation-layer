		Code status for BW
		==================

In general, this is development level software, not ready for prime time and
still in early stages of development.  Some portions are relatively complete,
but the majority is still in development.  Some files don't even compile.

The version number is indicated in the name of the tar file of the distribution
source.  Tested releases have a version number of <major>.<minor> such as
0.5.  Development builds have a version number of <major>.<minor>-<date>
such as 0.5-19981203.  This last example indicates a build subsequent to the
0.5 release.  Development builds are the most unstable, they may not
even compile.

Shared libraries are not built because the interface is changing too rapidly
for this to have any value.


As of 0.5, the following portions are relatively stable:

bwassert and trace
Directory
BFile
FileName
html
http
string

The GUI framework is the most unstable.  Virtually all of this code is expected
to change before the 0.6 release.  The GUI code in 0.5 is basically a proof of
concept to try out some of the ideas -- little beyond "hello world" works

In particular, the goals of 0.6 are:

separation of platform dependent and independent portions of GUI framework
more stock figures
image display
database access
customization and preference APIs (including rudimentary resources)
change startup to use a global "bwmain" instead of Process::main()

"Pens" should be simplified
	- No width
	- No cap/join styles
	- Only takes "solid" colours
	- I.E. their use is depreciated

"Brush" should be the primary tool

"Brushes" take "Paint"
	- can be a colour
	- can be a pattern
	- can be transparent
	- can be partially transparent

Child windows should default to redraw on move (so that patterns will
	line up)
ts_origin should be set so that everything painted under the same frame
	window will line up.
