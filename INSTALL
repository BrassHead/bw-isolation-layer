                  	BW installation instructions
                  	============================


Testing
=======

You need to have the following packages installed:
	c++11 compiler
	make
	Xlib development
	Xext development
	unixodbc development
	
To build and test the software, type

	make check

This compiles and runs some very simple tests within the "test" subdirectory, 
including a "hello world" program.  The UI tests are interactive, so you will
need to follow the instructions.


Installation
============

This is an isolation layer, install by placing or linking the source into your project
and then compiling and linking with calling code. For an example, look at the tests.
