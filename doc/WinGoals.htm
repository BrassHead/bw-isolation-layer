<H1>BW Windowing Design Goals</H1>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Visual elements need to be "designable" meaning that there is a separation
between the selection of a stock figure and its appearance.  Appearance can be
changed by a graphic designer without changing the code.
<LI>Dynamic content needs to be easy to implement.
<LI>It needs to be easy to create new visuals as well as use existing ones.
<LI>Supplied visual elements need to integrate seamlessly with 
domain objects.  This means without requiring application
code for data conversions and placing minimal constraints on domain object
structure.
<LI>Stock visuals for basic C++/BW data types.
<LI>Stock visuals for BW and C++ standard library types (containers).
<LI>Stock visuals for frequent operations (file selection, etc).
<LI>Stock visuals can be operated naturally by users familiar with 
the native platform controls.
<LI>Integration of 2D and 3D visual elements.
