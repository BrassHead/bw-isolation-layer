The canvas is a drawing surface upon which drawing tools can operate.

<DL>
<DT>Implementation:
<DD>The Canvas, Drawing Tools, and Paint each manage
elements of a GC as follows:
<PRE>
function		Paint
plane_mask		Paint
foreground		Paint
background		Paint, Press, Pen, Brush
line_width		Pen, Brush
line_style		Brush
cap_style		Pen, Brush
join_style		Brush
fill_style		Brush
fill_rule		Brush
arc_mode		Brush
tile			Paint
stipple		Paint
ts_x_origin		Canvas
ts_y_origin		Canvas
font			Press
subwindow_mode	Canvas
graphics_exposures	???
clip_x_origin		Canvas
clip_y_origin		Canvas
clip_mask		Canvas
dash_offset		Pen, Brush
dashes		Pen, Brush
</PRE>

GCs are allocated from a pool maintained by the Scene.  They are assigned
to each Canvas and to frequently used Paints.  Client code combines
a canvas, a drawing tool, and a Paint when constructing a tool.  The GC
assigned to the Paint will be used if the Canvas has
no clipping area defined.  Otherwise, the Canvas GC will be reused by all
tools.

GC attributes are not preserved.  Each tool sets the attributes it needs
on each use.  Paints tend to set more attributes than Tools.

Associated with each Figure is a Context object that holds the
clip Region.
