<H1>Figure</H1>
<P>
The Figure abstract base class defines an object that can draw itself
on demand and that may accept user input (mouse and/or keyboard).
<P>
Figure provides a set of services to it's subclasses and provides
default definitions of an interface called by the BW windowing system.
All member functions in this interface have default definitions except
for the 'draw' function.  The expectations and default actions of these
interface functions and services is detailed below.
<P>
There are a number of "mix-in" base classes that add services and
interface functions to the basics of the Figure class.  The BW
windowing system uses the presence of these mix-ins to control:
<UL>
<LI>the style of window displayed,
<LI>the types of adornments displayed,
<LI>which input events are processed, and
<LI>some behaviours of the Figure.
<UL>
<P>
In the long term, The mix-ins available will be:
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="Parent.html">Parent</A>
<DD>Indicates that this Figure can have child figures.
<DT><A HREF="Size.html">Size</A>
<DD>Indicates that this figure wants notification of size and location
changes within it's parent Figure.
<DT><A HREF="Frame.html">Frame</A>
<DD>Indicates that OS adornments should be drawn around this figure
when it is a child of the screen.
<DT><A HREF="Mouse.html">Mouse</A>
<DD>Indicates that this figure wants notification when the mouse pointer
enters or leaves the screen area drawn by the figure or when the
mouse is clicked over the figure.
<DT><A HREF="MouseMove.html">MouseMove</A>
<DD>Indicates that this figure want notification of mouse movements
when the mouse pointer is over the figure.
<DT><A HREF="Focus.html">Focus</A>
<DD>Indicates that this figure accepts keyboard input and can be the Keyboard
focus.
<DT><A HREF="RawKeyboard.html">RawKeyboard</A>
<DD>Indicates that this Figure needs detailed information about keypresses
and releases.
<DT><A HREF="VScroll.html">VScroll</A>
<DD>Indicates that this figure wants notification of vertical scrolling
events when it is a child of a scrolling figure.
<DT><A HREF="HScroll.html">HScroll</A>
<DD>Indicates that this figure wants notification of horizontal scrolling
events when it is a child of a scrolling figure.
<DT><A HREF="Main.html">Main</A>
<DD>Indicates that this Figure is a primary interface of the application
and will be displayed on startup.

<H1>Figure::doAction()</H1>
<P>
<I>
bool Figure::doAction( const String&amp; strCommand )
</I><P>
Initiate processing of an Action routine.
<P>
Processing starts at the parent of the calling control.  The Command argument
contains a string indicating which action should be taken.  The syntax of the
commands is application dependent.
<P>
Action processing generally goes up the Figure hierarchy until an ancestor
recognizes the command and takes the action.  If processing reaches the
screen, then the command is posted for processing by the 'main' routine in
applications Process object.
<P>
A 'true' return indicates that an ancestor processed the command.  A 'false'
return indicates that the command was posted to the 'main' routine if the
originating Figure is active or was discarded for inactive Figures.
<P>
The default 'main' routine handles the single command "quit" and ignores all
others.
