<H1>User Interface Style</H1>
<P>
The BW library does not force a particular UI style onto it's applications.
In the area of application "look", BW is expected to support and encourage
innovative and unique styles.  In the area of "feel", however, it is important
that users of BW applications are able to transfer their experience in other
applications to BW applications.  For this reason, some standards for 
"drivability" are strongly encouraged by the available interface elements.
This section documents these elements.

<P>
These are guidelines rather than hard rules -- every one of them will 
have exceptions in certain circumstances and sometimes they will conflict
with each other in a design.


<DL>
<DT>Object - Action
<DD>The general flow of control by the user involves selecting an object and
    then specifying the action to be performed on the object.  Actions can be
    direct (ie: draging or double clicking an object), from an application 
    menu, from a context (pop-up) menu, or from a toolbar.
    An obvious exception to this is the creation of new objects.
<DT>Mouse Cursor
<DD>The mouse cursor is owned by the user and should not be warped or 
    moved by the application independent of mouse movement.  
    If the application has different operating modes (where the action of 
    clicking the cursor varies), then these are indicated by different cursor
    shapes.
<DT>Mouse
<DD>The mouse is optional.  All functions of an application need to have
    keyboard equivalents.
<DT>Mouse buttons
<DD>The leftmost mouse button is the primary mouse button. It is used to 
    select (click), manipulate (drag), and open (double click) objects.
    The rightmost button brings up a context menu for the object.  Applications
    should not assume that a middle button is available.  Mouse clicks and
    drags 
    can be combined with Shift, Control, and Alt keys for additional functions.
    Shift-Left click is reserved for extending the current selection to the
    mouse location.  Control-Left click is reserved for extending the 
    selection by adding the item under the mouse cursor.  While a draging 
    action moves an object, Control-Drag (with the left button) copies it
    at the new location.
<DT>Application Menus
<DD>Menus are the primary means of accessing program functions.  All program
    functions should be available from application menus at the top of
    the main windows of the application.
<DT>Context menus
<DD>Context (pop-up) menus can provide an abbreviated list of actions for the
    currently selected items.  These items are redundant with items in the
    application menu.
<DT>Button bars
<DD>An alternate action specifier for the most common actions.
</DL>

<H1>Reserved key assignments</H1>

The following table presents a list of key assignments that are reserved
for specific actions.  Most of these should be implemented in BW applications.
The key combinations indicated "(by OS)" are reserved for actions by the OS 
and should not be defined within the application.
