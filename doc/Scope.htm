<H1>Scope</H1>
What facilities are needed?  
The full intended scope is illustrated by this 
diagram which was the start of the project.

<P>
Thus the "packages" of BW facilities are:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="Language.htm">Language</A>
<LI><A HREF="Windowing.htm">Graphics</A>
<LI><A HREF="Files.htm">Files and directories</A>
<LI><A HREF="Parameters.htm">Resources and preferences</A>
<LI><A HREF="Processes.htm">Processes and threads</A>
<LI><A HREF="Persistence.htm">Persistent storage</A>
<LI><A HREF="Network.htm">Network access</A>
<LI><A HREF="Distributed.htm">Distributed objects</A>
<LI><A HREF="FileFormat.htm">File format experts</A>
<LI><A HREF="Scripts.htm">Scripting</A>
<LI><A HREF="Help.htm">Help system</A>
<LI><A HREF="Localization.htm">Localization</A>
</UL>
<P>
This is a big project and it will not succeed by pie in the sky dreaming
or big bang implementation.  Thus, we expect to drive the implementation
by doing real applications and working to provide the necessary isolation
layer as required.  
These <A HREF=Applications.htm>applications</A> will get 
increasingly sophisticated
and thus require an increasingly sophisticated isolation layer.
<P>
What things are not in the scope?
<DL>
<DT>The Makefile
<DD>The mechanism to build BW applications is not defined as part of
BW and the makefile is not considered part of the "code" that 
has long duration.  Note that in order to have standard makefiles, you
need to define a shell, a set of standard utilities, and standard options
for development tools and then provide isolation tools for all of these
on the target platform.  This is a huge effort with a small return.
Furthermore, most modern environments have a lot of automation for 
makefile creation, so this is not, in practice, a huge portability problem.
<DT>Installation
<DD>BW applications are installed in some platform dependent way.
