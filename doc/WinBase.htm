<H1>Base Services</H1>
<P>
This section documents the base services of the windowing subsystem in BW.
The base services provide a level of functionality approximately equivalent
to Xlib in X Windows.  That is: manipulation of basic windows, drawing primitives,
fonts, colours, bitmaps, events, keyboard focus, and clipping regions.
<P>
This document Is not a specification, but merely indicates a direction
and is used as a cross check on the actual design.  Only the portions of
this functionality actually used by some BW application (or a reasonable
extension of one) will be implemented.  This is consistent with the 
concept that BW is an isolation layer for a set of applications and not 
a general isolation layer for any arbitrary graphic application.
<P>
This design work provides the framework so that new features can be added
consistently over time as they are required for BW applications.  It is
also a cross check on the design because it's completeness can be used
to identify design alternatives that are insufficiently general to be
expandable in ways known to be needed by some applications.
<P>
Because it cross references the two primary platforms for delivery of BW,
it highlights routines that may have to be added to one of the platforms
in the implementation.
<P>
These calls are based on a analysis of the calls and events in 
<A HREF="WinBaseWin32.htm">WIN32</A> and
<A HREF="WinBaseX.htm">Xlib.</A>  These lists are "complete" in the following
sense:  All of the Xlib calls are listed and for each Xlib call a search 
was made for WIN32 call(s) that provide the a similar service.
<P>
See the detailed documentation (extracted from the source) for
specifics on which routines are available, their parameters, and 
notes on their usage.
