<H1>Help System</H1>
<P>
Plan of record is to use HTML for help text and to define a convenient
set of routines to connect context sensitive help.  This implies an HTML
view control as well as a way of storing and accessing HTML documents from
structured storage.  Version 1 should just invoke an outside HTML browser on a
set of regular files stored in a convenient place and installed 
with the application executable.
